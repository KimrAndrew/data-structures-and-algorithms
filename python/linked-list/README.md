# Singly Linked List

## Node

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node

## Linked List

- Create a Linked List class
- Within you Linked List class, include a head property
  - Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created
- The class should contain the following methods:
  - insert
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance

- includes
  - Arguments: value
  - Returns: Boolean
    - Indicates whether that value exists as a Node's value somewhere within the list.
- to string
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
  - Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
  - Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

## Approach & Efficiency

- Built using TDD workflow of writing the tests before creating the methods being tested
- insert:
  - Time: O(1)
  - Space: O(N)
- includes:
  - Time: O(N)
  - Space: O(N)
- to string:
  - Time: O(N)
  - Space: O(N)
  
## Linked List Insertions

## Feature Tasks
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- append
  - arguments: new value
  - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- insert before
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- insert after
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
